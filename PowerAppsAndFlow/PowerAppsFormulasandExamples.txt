Conditional Formatting 

IF Condition Formula Syntax 

IF(Test_Condtion, [WhenTrue], [WhenFalse])

Test_Condition : is something that can be evaluated as true or false
Ex 5 > 10 is false

IF(YourForm.Mode = FormMode.New, Parent.DisplayMode.Edit, Parent.DisplayMode.View)

In my environment 
If(SharePointForm1.Mode = FormMode.New, Parent.DisplayMode.Edit,Parent.DisplayMode.View)

If You want to make the field as currency, here is how I do it for USD 

"$" & Text(Parent.Default, "0.00")

Visiblity of Fields on the Form based on Form Type (Example below shows that The field is Hidden on New Item Form)
If(SharePointForm1.Mode = FormMode.New, false, true)

If we want to change background of any Card based on value of the field,

If(Value(DataCardValue7.Text)>1000, Red, LightGreen)

The above example checks the value of the DataCardValue7 changed to numeric and compared with 1000 if it is above the background will be RED otherwise its gonna be LightGreen

Current User Formula is User()

If Form is New then Show Read Only 
If form is not new and CurrentUSer is a manager Show EditForm

If(SharePointForm1.Mode = FormMode.New, Parent.DisplayMode.View, If(User().Email = ThisItem.Manager.Email, Parent.DisplayMode, Parent.DisplayMode.View) )
